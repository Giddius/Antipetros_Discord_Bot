# Proposals


## .) Polling

A feature to create polls, let them run for a specified time and afterwards get the result in text form and as a graph. Able to set it so that users can only choose one option or multiples. also restrict voting by role, but having the poll public. Afterwards can create a report of the poll and who voted what ('regarding meeting point to no explain if you voted not')

### Needed Infos

- How many options max (ever, there is a hard limit of about 20-25, I can work around if need, but would like to know if it is really needed)
- What info you want after the poll has finished (who voted what, who voted when, ...)
- what of the poll do you want to be able to set via the command, with defaults (the title, the description, the emojis to use,...)
- what kind of graph or if you want a graph afterwards.
- do you want a text report afterwards?
- auto notification of eligible voters?
