```py
@AntiDEVtros create_giveaway [--title] [--end-date] [--num-winners] [--end-message] [--start-message] [--enter-emoji]
```

**Flags**

__--title__
    short: `-t`
    type: `TEXT`
    default: `Antistasi Give-Away`
    description: The text that is at the top of the give-away embed

__--end-date__
    short: `-end`
    type: `TEXT`
    default: `24 hours`
    description: Amount of time the give-away should run. The bot will parse it from normal speach (i.e. "3 days and 2 hours", "1 week", "10 seconds")

__--num-winners__
    short: `-nw`
    type: `NUMBER`
    default: `1`
    description: How many winners should be selected at the end.
                 If less people participated than this number, the bot chooses all participants as winners (i.e. --num-winners 4, participants 2, 2 winners get choosen)

__--end-message__
    short: `-emsg`
    type: `TEXT`
    default: `Give away has finished!`
    description: The message that should show up on the embed that announces the winners.

__--start-message__
    short: `-smsg`
    type: `TEXT`
    default: `NO DEFAULT`
    description: The message that should show up on the embed, where people can participate.

__--enter-emoji__
    short: `-em`
    type: `EMOJI`
    default: `üéÅ`
    description: The emoji people have to use to enter the give-away. All other emojis that people add to the give-away embed get deleted to keep joksters at bay.

**Overall Description**
After invocation of the command the bot will present you with an embed, that summarizes your input and he will ask you to confirm it via click on the ‚úÖ emoji.

The bot will choose via an non-deterministic RNG, that is also used for password secrets and so on. Therefore it is as random as you can get with python.
After the give-away has finished it will send a DM with the name of the winners to the user that initiated the give-away. If no one participated, the bot will delete the give-away and also
send a DM to the initiator that the give-away failed because no one participated.
Also after the give-away has finished it will delete the embed where people can add the emoji to enter and replace it with an embed that contains the `end-message` and the name of the winners.
Flags can be set in any order you wish and work just like CommandLineInteface Flags for CMD or SHELL.

**IMPORTANT**
All entries need to be quoted if they have spaces in them. e.g.: `@AntiPetros giveaway -t "this is the title" -smsg "this is the start message" -end "3 days and 9 hours"`

**Example**
```cmd
@AntiPetros giveaway -t "Example Give-Away" -em üéÅ -smsg "test give away please if you can read this hit the emoji to help me test it" -end "15 min" -emsg "Congratulations you have won the gift of friendship" -nw 2
```
