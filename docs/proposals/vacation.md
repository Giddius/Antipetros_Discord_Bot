So after a new clusterfuck yesterday, I have to say:

***I will be taking a week of vacation from the bot***

**__This means:__**
- I still will be fixing bugs if they come up
- but stuff that may just works sub optimal will have to wait at least a week to be fixed
- I may or may not will write some commands, that I find interesting, for the bot and ask for testing from the people that reacted to the message calling for testers. This will be a day to day decision.
- I still will be working on other stuff for antistasi or other projects.
- will last about a week (current plan is from now until about Monday the 12. of July)

**__Reasons:__**
*This part is just some explanation and a rant about a few things that I just want to finally say out loud and not having it bounce around in my head like an antitank shell in an APC*
*SO THIS COULD BE SKIPPED AND I DON'T EXCPECT FROM ANYONE THAT THEY HAVE TO READ IT*
