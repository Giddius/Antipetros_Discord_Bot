    31: "FAQ No 31\n:regional_indicator_q: How can I port a map for Antistasi?\n:regional_indicator_a: Read below. Please note, that's not an easy task.\n\nFirst and foremost please note that we don't take any responsibility and will not give any support if anything goes wrong as it is not an official ported map but done by yourself and we can't even say based on which version you have done your map port.\n\nOne of the largest parts is the creation of the mission sqm. For Antistasi to run properly you need a lof of placed markers, units and modules of which some require specific names. These names are crucial so that the code can read out what a marker/module/unit is suppossed to be/do. Best thing here would be to look at already ported maps.\n\nOn the general topic of PROPER  map-porting, make sure you have adapted fn_initGarrisons.sqf, fn_initVarCommon.sqf, you have added the map relevant information in the stringtable.xml and replaced all the stringtable references within the mission.sqm as well as the description.ext.\nIf you want to go proper-proper, export the hightmap of the map of your choice, convert the ~30-50mb .emf file into a reasonable sized .jpg and put in on the whiteboard which you then can have on the ingame map, showing the correct map of your choice instead of the one used in the template you copy.\n\nAlso, you would need to create the roadsDB file as well as the navGrid file.\nThe tool for creating the navGrid file can be found in the NavGridTools folder and it also contains a proper readme which contains exact instructions on how to do it.\nTo create the roadsDB you would need to use following code and then safe the information in a properly named sqf file:\ncopyToClipboard (\"{roadsX setVariable [_x select 0,_x select 1]} forEach \" + str (call A3A_fnc_generateRoadsDB))",
    32: "FAQ No 32\n:regional_indicator_q: I HATE 3CB AND WANT CUP!!!!!\n:regional_indicator_a: We currently can not implement CUP as a modset due to possible code issues and time constraints.\nIt IS on the list but there is certainly NO ETA.\nSo please stop molesting Meerkat, for fucks sake!!",
    33: "FAQ No 33\n:regional_indicator_q: Me have an aircraftcarrier spawned like in the picture\n:regional_indicator_a: Me should not load unsupported mods like CUP Units and CUP vehicles as they break stuff\nTo answer your question \"Which mods are compatible\", please read FAQ No 10 in this channel.",
