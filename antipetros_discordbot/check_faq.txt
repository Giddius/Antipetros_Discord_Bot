🇶 **Me have an aircraftcarrier spawned like in the picture **
🇦 Me should not load unsupported mods like CUP Units and CUP vehicles as they break stuff
To answer your question "Which mods are compatible", please read FAQ No 10 in this channel.

It **IS** on the list but there is certainly **NO ETA**.

**FAQ No 31**
🇶 **How can I port a map for Antistasi? **
🇦 Read below. Please note, that's not an easy task.

First and foremost please note that we don't take any responsibility and will not give any support if anything goes wrong as it is not an official ported map but done by yourself and we can't even say based on which version you have done your map port.

One of the largest parts is the creation of the mission sqm. For Antistasi to run properly you need a lof of placed markers, units and modules of which some require specific names. These names are crucial so that the code can read out what a marker/module/unit is suppossed to be/do. Best thing here would be to look at already ported maps.

On the general topic of **PROPER**  map-porting, make sure you have adapted fn_initGarrisons.sqf, fn_initVarCommon.sqf, you have added the map relevant information in the stringtable.xml and replaced all the stringtable references within the mission.sqm as well as the description.ext.
If you want to go proper-proper, export the hightmap of the map of your choice, convert the ~30-50mb .emf file into a reasonable sized .jpg and put in on the whiteboard which you then can have on the ingame map, showing the correct map of your choice instead of the one used in the template you copy.

Also, you would need to create the roadsDB file as well as the navGrid file.
The tool for creating the navGrid file can be found in the NavGridTools folder and it also contains a proper readme which contains exact instructions on how to do it.
To create the roadsDB you would need to use following code and then safe the information in a properly named sqf file:
```sqf
copyToClipboard ("{roadsX setVariable [_x select 0,_x select 1]} forEach " + str (call A3A_fnc_generateRoadsDB))```

**FAQ No 4**
🇶 **How do I save parameters?**
🇦 HOW TO SAVE PARAMETERS:
To have the same parameters all the time you start the mission you need to do following things:
**for locally hosted MP game**
--> Either take the PBO from the download folder or from the release page on GitHub.
--> Save the PBO in your C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\USERNAME\mpmissions folder.
--> Use the PBO manager to unpack it.
--> Go to params.hpp and change the values you want to change.
--> DO NOT pack it back into a PBO but leave it as a folder - Arma only reads out other folders in there, not PBOs.
--> Start the game, launch the mission.

**for hosted MP on a dedicated server**
-->go to your server.cfg and set up your mission cycle as shown in the example above.
-->The class names as well as the values which can be set can be found in the missionDescription/params.hpp file
https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3-Antistasi/blob/master/A3-Antistasi/MissionDescription/params.hpp

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SHOWN CODE IS AN EXAMPLE AND YOU AT LEAST NEED TO ADAPT THE NAME OF THE MISSION**
```
// MISSIONS CYCLE (see below)
class Missions {
class Mission1    {
    template ="Antistasi-Malden-2-2-1.Malden";
        difficulty = "Custom";
            class Params {
            switchComm = 0;
            pMarkers = 0;
            AISkill = 2;
            unlockItem = 40;
            memberOnlyMagLimit = 60;
            teamSwitchDelay = 1800;
        };
};
};                // An empty Missions class means there will be no mission rotation

missionWhitelist[] = {

}; //an empty whitelist means there is no restriction on what missions' available```

If you have never setup a server, please use Google to get at least a basic knowledge before you attempt setting one up.
